# SDL2-C-Pong

My attempt to make Pong in C.

I hope you find something useful in my code but please, be careful, I just started programming in C and have no experience in game development whatsoever.

# Dependencies

- gcc
- SDL2
- SDL2_image
- SDL2_ttf
- SDL2_mixer

# Installation

Once you have installed SDL2 in your system:

```
git clone https://github.com/0xa0b0c/SDL2-C-Pong.git
cd SDL2-C-Pong
make && make run
```

# "Features"

- Background music and sound effects.
- Startup and pause screen.
- Decent gameplay (although very simple).
