# SDL2-C-Pong

My attempt to make Pong in C.

I hope you find something useful in my code but please, be careful, I just started programming in C and have no experience in game development whatsoever.

# Dependencies

- gcc
- SDL2
- SDL2_image
- SDL2_ttf
- SDL2_mixer
- cppcheck (you can skip this, please read comments in Makefile)

# Installation

Once you have installed SDL2 in your system:

```
git clone https://github.com/0xa0b0c/SDL2-C-Pong.git
cd SDL2-C-Pong
make && make run
```

# "Features"

- Sound.
- Startup and pause screen.
- Challenging AI (I think).
